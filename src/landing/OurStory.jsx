            Growing up as a mechanicâ€™s son, our founder Pennington Nguyen has been around cars his entire life. From an early age, he learned how to detail from his father and fell in love with the brilliant shine that follows a fresh wax. Years later, while working as a marketing director at a dealership, being surrounded by new automobiles reignited that passion, leading to the creation of beclean. Driven to bring that same level of refinement to others, beclean was built to deliver a premium ceramic coating experience.
